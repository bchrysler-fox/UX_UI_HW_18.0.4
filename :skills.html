        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>User research is the first step to ensuring that we have a website that is approachable and usable. Focus on user research for me means casting a wide net and getting input from people that may not be in the target audience, but can give absolutely valuable input.</p>

        <h3>Interface Design</h3>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>The final step is creating the code, the foundation of the web page, based upon the input from users. With the input, my intent with designing is to be mindful of all different cultures and abilities, and I focus on making things as accessible as possible.</p>
